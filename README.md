# 🧠 Deep Learning: CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into 10 categories. All work was done using **Jupyter Notebook** within the **Anaconda environment**.

CIFAR-10 is a popular benchmark dataset that includes 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
